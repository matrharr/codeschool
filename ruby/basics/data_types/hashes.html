<h1>terms: key, value, constant time O(1)</h1>


<h1>A hash can have a few different meanings in computer science, but within Ruby a hash is a data structure that matches a key with a corresponding value, both of which can be any data type, and places the pair on a list with other pairs. Hashes are useful when you want some piece of data to be associated with another. Relationships between pieces of data are pretty common so hashes make it easy to put together a list of pairs that represent those relationships.</h1>

<h1>The main advantage to hashes is that you can have a very fast lookup if you know the key. A hash lookup has a constant time lookup, meaning that no matter the size of the hash, it will find the corresponding value in the same amount of time.</h1>
