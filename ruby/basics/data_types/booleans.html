<h1>terms: control flow, break statements, if/else</h1>



<h1>You're probably already super familiar with booleans. A boolean can only have two values: true or false. Super simple, that's that. Because booleans are easy to understand, let's look at some ways they are commonly used in software programs.</h1>

<h1>Control Flow: A common scenario in software applications is depending on user input, different code will run, resulting in different possible outputs. Imagine you have a virtual dog program. When you type in 'sit' you want the dog to sit, when you type in 'speak' you want the dog to bark, etc. This scenario on the front end translates to an if/else statement on the backend. Whichever of the coded inputs matches the user input will return true and then the corresponding code will run. This is similar to a decision tree. That's all control flow is, just true and false lines that control what branches of code will run</h1>


<h1>Break Statements: When you are executing a loop you run the risk of mistakenly creating an infinite loop. An infinite loop is a loop that never breaks and ultimately leads to the program crashing. So every single loop must have a break statement. Break statements are looking to break a loop once a condition is satisfied or if a condition is no longer specified.</h1>
