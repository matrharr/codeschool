<h1>terms: concat, mutable, interpolation</h1>

<h1> A good place to start with strings is to just think of them as letters. "A" is a string, 'b' is a string and '8' is a string. Anything that you wrap in parentheses is officially a string in ruby. Most of the time when you want to communicate something to a user, you will print a string as the output.

<br>
concat: What happens if you try to add two strings? They combine to one string, which is called concatenation.
