<h1>terms: input, output, function, data type</h1>

<h3>
  Understanding the concept of data types and the specifics of a few common types is a crucial early step to writing software. 
</h3>

<h3>
  When you are programming, really every step is thinking about the current state of your input. You have some function that is going to perform some action. You send some data input into the function, the function does some stuff and then you receive some output. This is generally what happens with everything in programming. 
</h3>

<h3>
  When I refer to input, all it means is data that is being put into a function. And so data could refer to a number, a letter, a symbol, a sound, a location or whatever. All of these possibilities boil down to things you can type on a keyboard. So you can type a lot of different things and you will want to do different stuff depending on your situation. Perhaps you want to take the square root of a number, perhaps you want to prepend 'happy birthday' to someone's name or perhaps you want to order a list of items.

<h3>
  Depending on what you want to do, your data will be a certain type. So you have to learn about data types. The most basic data types in ruby are: string, hash, array, number, float, booleans, symbol.
